# Project Chamaeleon

This repository is a project that I created in my second year of DAM ("Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma") with Unity. It consists in a simplified copy of the game "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon" where you move on the limited map searching for the stairs to get to the next level. It has 2 levels and a boss level. When you kill the boss, you win the game.

## Origin
Chamaeleon (/kəˈmiːliən/) is a small constellation in the southern sky. It is named after the chameleon, a kind of lizard. It was first defined in the 16th century. 

Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.[2] It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. Johann Bayer was the first uranographer to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas. It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars.[3]
